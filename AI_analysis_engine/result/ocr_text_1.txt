Introduction to Quantum Mechanics 1.What is Quantum Mechanics? Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles 2.Historical Background Quantum mechanics emerged in the early 20th century with key contributions from scientists like Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, and Schrodinger.. 3.Fundamental Principles -Wave-particle duality - The uncertainty principle -Quantum superposition - Entanglement 4.Key Experiments - Double-slit experiment - Photoelectric effect - Stern-Gerlach experiment 5.Applications of Quantum Mechanics - Semiconductors and transistors - MRI machines -Quantum computing
